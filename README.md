# Beautage Laravel

Laravel storefront for the Beautage static HTML theme. All theme pages are Blade views with a shared layout, public assets, and named GET routes.

## Setup

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Replace `public/images/beautagelogosquare2.png` with your brand logo (the HTML theme referenced this file locally; a tiny placeholder is committed until you add the real asset).

## Theme conversion

Static HTML sources can be re-imported with:

```bash
python3 scripts/convert_html_to_blade.py
```

Place source HTML files in the uploads directory configured in that script.

## Hostinger deploy

On the server, from the project root (your domain folder):

```bash
bash scripts/deploy-hostinger.sh
```

Skip migrations if this release has none:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy-hostinger.sh --no-migrate
```

Override binaries if needed: `PHP_BIN=/usr/bin/php COMPOSER_BIN=/usr/local/bin/composer bash scripts/deploy-hostinger.sh`

The script pulls `main`, runs Composer, copies `public/*` into `public_html/`, links `public_html/storage`, caches config/routes/views, and sets permissions. Do not edit `public_html/index.php` paths; Laravel’s default `../vendor` paths are correct.
